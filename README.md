The ad recommendation system is a machine learning model that uses the reinforcement learning approach with the UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm. The UCB algorithm is a technique that allows the model to balance the exploration and exploitation of the ad recommendations.

The system starts with a fixed number of ads and a threshold for the selection index. In each round, the system selects an ad to recommend to the user based on the UCB algorithm. The algorithm takes into account the number of times an ad has been selected, the total reward received from the ad, and the confidence interval of the reward.

After the ad recommendation, the system receives feedback from the user in the form of a binary variable indicating whether the ad was clicked or not. The model then updates the selection index for each ad based on the feedback received.

The system continues to make recommendations and receive feedback until the algorithm learns which ad has the highest selection index. At this point, the system stops making recommendations and recommends only the best ad to the user.

Overall, the ad recommendation system provides an efficient and effective way to optimize ad selection and increase user engagement with the ads.
